# SobekCM-plugin-simple-endpoints
A sample SobekCM plug-in which adds simple results and item endpoints.  This is provided as another sample plug-in, as these endpoints are likely to be added with the core system as well.

This plug-in requires the very latest code to work, due to changes in the SobekCM code base.

This plug-in uses code developed with Richard Bernardy that is also available at https://github.com/rbernardy/SobekCM-plugin-endpoint-EDS

This was developed at the SobekCM Code Camp 2017.
